# Comprehensive Analysis: Volume Aggregated Spot & Futures Indicator

## 1. Introduction & Context

### Primary Objective

This PineScript indicator is designed to provide comprehensive cryptocurrency volume analysis by aggregating volume data across multiple exchanges for both spot and futures markets. The indicator offers various visualization modes including raw volume, volume deltas, exchange dominance percentages, liquidation estimation, and traditional volume-based technical indicators.

### Author Description

The author describes this as a "comprehensive approach to Aggregated Volume Data" that works on almost all cryptocurrency tickers. The indicator aggregates volume information from multiple exchanges and currency pairs, offering various display modes and calculation methods. The indicator is explicitly designed for CRYPTO ONLY markets and aims to give traders insights into volume dynamics across the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

### Key Takeaways

- The indicator is specifically designed for cryptocurrency markets only
- It can aggregate data from up to 9 different exchanges simultaneously
- Multiple visualization modes provide different perspectives on volume data
- Some calculations (Delta, Liquidations) are estimates based on available data
- Recent updates improved volume calculation accuracy and added new features

## 2. Code Analysis

### Script Walkthrough

The indicator's structure can be broken down into several key components:

1. **Setup and Configuration**: The script starts by defining the indicator parameters and setting up extensive user inputs for customization.
    
2. **Volume Data Collection**:
    
    - The `GetTicker()` function constructs ticker symbols for different exchanges
    - `GetRequest()` fetches volume data from TradingView
    - `GetExchange()` collects volume data from selected exchanges
    - `EditVolume()` processes the volume data based on user settings
3. **Volume Processing**:
    
    - Data is collected for both spot and futures markets
    - Volume is processed according to the user's calculation preference (SUM, AVG, etc.)
    - Currency conversions are applied based on the selected volume unit
4. **Mode-specific Calculations**:
    
    - Each display mode has its own calculation logic
    - OBV (On Balance Volume) uses cumulative signed volume
    - MFI (Money Flow Index) calculates the ratio of positive to negative money flow
    - Delta calculates buying vs. selling volume based on candle structure
    - Liquidations estimates potential liquidation volume from futures-spot difference
5. **Visualization**:
    
    - Appropriate plots are created based on the selected mode
    - Color coding is applied based on market conditions
    - An optional table displays exchange-specific volume information

### Technical Indicators/Methods Used

- **OBV (On Balance Volume)**: Cumulative indicator that adds or subtracts volume based on price movement
- **MFI (Money Flow Index)**: Volume-weighted oscillator that measures buying and selling pressure
- **Delta Calculation**: Estimates buying vs. selling volume based on candle structure
- **Cumulative Delta**: Running sum of delta values over a specified period
- **Liquidation Estimation**: Identifies abnormal differences between futures and spot volume
- **Exchange Dominance**: Calculates percentage contribution of each exchange to total volume

### Innovations or Unique Mechanics

- **Multi-exchange Aggregation**: Combines volume data from multiple sources for a comprehensive view
- **Candle Structure Analysis**: Uses candle anatomy to estimate buying/selling pressure
- **Exchange-specific Volume Visualization**: Color-codes volume by exchange to identify market drivers
- **Currency Conversion**: Displays volume in different base currencies (USD, EUR, RUB)
- **Liquidation Estimation**: Novel approach to estimating liquidation events through volume differentials

### Potential Pitfalls

- **Approximation Accuracy**: The author acknowledges that delta and liquidation calculations are approximations
- **Data Dependency**: Accuracy depends on the quality and availability of exchange data
- **Performance Impact**: Requesting data from many exchanges simultaneously may affect performance
- **Repainting Risk**: Some calculations based on current candle may change as the candle forms
- **Currency Conversion Accuracy**: Exchange rate data for conversions may introduce additional variability

## 3. Inputs & Configuration

### Effect of Input Adjustments

- **Mode Selection**: Fundamentally changes what data is displayed and how it's calculated
    
- **Data Type**: "Single" focuses on the current ticker only, while "Aggregated" combines multiple sources
    
- **Volume By**: Changes the scale of displayed values based on the selected currency
    
- **Calculate By**:
    
    - SUM: Total volume across all selected exchanges
    - AVG: Mean volume, useful for standardizing across exchanges
    - MEDIAN: Central volume value, reduces impact of outliers
    - VARIANCE: Shows volume variability, highlighting inconsistency
- **MA Period**: Lower values make the MA more reactive but noisier; higher values smooth the MA but increase lag
    
- **Lookback**: Affects the sensitivity of Cumulative Delta and MFI calculations
    
- **Exchange Selection**: Adding more exchanges increases data completeness but may impact performance
