*   **Phase 1 - Node.js CopilotKitRuntime Setup & Refinement (COMPLETED):** (Carried Over)
*   **Phase 1 - Basic Frontend Development (React/CopilotKit) (COMPLETED):** (Carried Over)
*   **Phase 1 - Package Upgrades (COMPLETED):** (Carried Over)
*   **Phase 1 - Initial End-to-End Testing (ATTEMPTED):** (Carried Over)
*   **Initial Documentation & Memory Bank Update:** Core Memory Bank files updated. (Carried Over & Ongoing)
*   **Asset Collection:** (Carried Over)
*   **All 12 Specialized ADK Agents Implemented & Refactored (Phase 1 Complete):**
    *   All 12 specialized agents and `OrchestratorAgent` are implemented and refactored to class-based `LlmAgent`s with `output_schema` and `FunctionTool`.
*   **Backend Server Operational (COMPLETED PREVIOUS SESSION):**
    *   Uvicorn backend server starts successfully.
*   **Backend Image Upload Capability (COMPLETED PREVIOUS PART OF SESSION):**
    *   `backend/main.py`: Added `/upload-chart-image/` FastAPI endpoint, saves images, returns `file:///` URL.
    *   CopilotKit action `runCryptoTaOrchestrator` updated for `image_url`.
*   **Core Agent Refactoring (COMPLETED PREVIOUS PART OF SESSION):**
    *   `ContextAgent`, `StructureAgent`, `RangesAgent`, `LiquidityAgent` refactored.
    *   `OrchestratorAgent` updated.
*   **Frontend Image Upload UI (COMPLETED THIS SESSION):**
    *   `copilotkit-react-frontend/src/App.tsx`: Implemented UI for file selection and upload to backend.
    *   Displays uploaded image URL or errors.
    *   Dynamically updates `<CopilotChat>` instructions with the image URL.
    *   `copilotkit-react-frontend/src/App.css`: Styled the new upload section.
    *   Resolved TypeScript import error in `App.tsx`.
*   **Backend Stability Fixes (COMPLETED THIS SESSION):**
    *   Corrected `ImportError` in `backend/agents/__init__.py`.
    *   Updated Uvicorn run command in `backend/main.py` to `backend.main:app` for robust reloading.

## 2. What's Left to Build / In Progress (Next Steps)

*   **Node.js Runtime Configuration for Action Proxying**: Ensure Node.js CopilotKit runtime proxies `runCryptoTaOrchestrator` (with `image_url`) to the Python backend.
*   **Agent Image URL Consumption & Testing**:
    *   Verify `ContextAgent` receives and can use the `image_url`.
    *   Refactor `MomentumAgent` and `DerivativesAgent` prompts/logic if needed for `image_url`.
    *   Test image processing flow with actual images.
*   **RAG System Integration**: Connect actual knowledge base for enhanced analysis for agents requiring document search (Momentum, Derivatives).
*   **Testing and Refinement**: Test complete 12-agent workflow with real MCP tools and refine outputs.
*   **Further MCP Integration**: Integrate real MCP tools for other agents as needed (e.g., CoinGecko for price data in Context Agent).
*   **Frontend-Backend Full Test**: Conduct a full end-to-end test from the React UI through the Node.js runtime to the Python backend and back, including image upload.
*   **Memory Bank Maintenance:** Continue to update all Memory Bank files with new learnings, decisions, and progress.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Overall:** All 12 specialized ADK agents and the orchestrator are implemented and refactored. The Uvicorn backend server is running successfully. Backend and frontend UI for image upload functionality are implemented.
*   **Blocker:** **RESOLVED** (Previous session) - ADK import and Pydantic validation errors.
*   **Risks:**
    *   Node.js runtime configuration for action proxying.
    *   LLM's ability to correctly interpret and use `file:///` URLs for image analysis.
    *   Complexity of integrating real RAG systems.
    *   Potential for unforeseen issues during comprehensive end-to-end testing.
    *   Maintaining performance with increased agent complexity and external API calls.

## 4. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **Initial Plan (OpenAI Agents SDK):** Shifted to Google-centric stack (ADK, A2A). (Carried Over)
*   **Backend AG-UI Streaming:** Shifted from manual SSE implementation to using the `copilotkit` Python SDK for FastAPI. (Carried Over)
*   **Frontend:** AG-UI with React/CopilotKit. (Carried Over)
*   **RAG:** Requirement confirmed, implementation details deferred. (Carried Over)
*   **Agent Structure:** 12-specialized-agent model. All 12 agents implemented and refactored to class-based `LlmAgent`. (Updated this session)
*   **ADK Agent Discovery/Invocation:** Refined understanding. (Carried Over)
*   **Gemini Model Access:** Confirmed Google AI Studio API key. (Carried Over)
*   **MCP Tool Integration:** Real MCP tools integrated for some agents. (Carried Over)
*   **ADK Session Management:** Global ADK Runner instance. (Carried Over)
*   **ADK Agent Implementation Pattern (SOLIDIFIED):**
    *   Standardized on `LlmAgent` from `google.adk.agents` as the base class.
    *   Adopted `FunctionTool` from `google.adk.tools.function_tool` for wrapping Python callables.
    *   Utilizing the `output_schema` parameter in `LlmAgent.__init__` with Pydantic models.
    *   Corrected Pydantic field naming conventions (e.g., `_meta` to `meta` with alias).
*   **Image Handling (NEW THIS SESSION):**
    *   FastAPI backend handles image uploads and provides `file:///` URLs to agents.
    *   React frontend provides UI for image upload and contextualizes CopilotChat.
*   **Uvicorn Execution (Refined THIS SESSION):**
    *   Using `python -m backend.main` and `backend.main:app` for robust execution and reloading.
*   **CopilotKit Versioning & API Nuances:** (Carried Over)
