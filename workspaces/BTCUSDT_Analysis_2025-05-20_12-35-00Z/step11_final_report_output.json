  "notes": "Trade setup prioritizes bearish structure and liquidity zones confirmed by moderate bearish momentum and derivatives indicating mild selling pressure and position reduction. Elevated greed sentiment and mixed news add caution. The poor risk-reward ratio (0.61) significantly lowers confidence and increases risk, necessitating conservative position sizing (2% risk). Continuous monitoring of momentum and derivatives is critical to detect potential short squeeze or invalidation scenarios. Alternative bullish scenario involves price breaking above bearish FVG and order block resistance, which would invalidate the short setup.",
