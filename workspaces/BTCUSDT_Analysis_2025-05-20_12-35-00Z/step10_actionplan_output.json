  "notes": "The action plan prioritizes entering a short near current resistance zones with strict stop loss above key bearish FVG and order blocks. Given low confidence and poor risk-reward ratio, position sizing is conservative (2% risk). Continuous monitoring of momentum and derivatives data is crucial to detect potential short squeeze or invalidation. Re-entry or exit decisions should factor in price behavior relative to key resistance and breakout levels."
